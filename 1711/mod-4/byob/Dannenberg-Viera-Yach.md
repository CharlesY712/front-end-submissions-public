# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/CharlesY712/BYOB/blob/d86a9cf1019308855f8190f6711b366fef135839/server.js#L44-L68)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Having never made a query request before, we used the documentation and were able to get it working on our first attempt.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code]()

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

We had absolutely zero css for this project. Having gone through 6 months of Front-End program only to not style felt not awesome.
